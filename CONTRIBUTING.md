Contributions are very welcome!

We adhere to PEP-8, and code is meant to be easily understood.

The primary goal of the library is to make it very easy for people to write
perceptual tests (and other tests) using Selenium. The API user comes first.

Tests are not yet implemented (that'd be a most welcome contribution at this
point), so please be sure to do a thorough manual test in the interim.
